Using Gatsby and Sanity CMS, I created this website for a pizza shop that allows a client to manage their content on via the CMS admin panel. 
This decoupled CMS allows for faster page load times, better security and more modularity than a tradition monoloithic CMS archetechture, plus working
with Gatsby is always a pleasant experience.
